Mongoid::Errors::InvalidIndex (
Problem:
  Invalid index specification on To: [[:loc, "2d"]], {:background=>true}
Summary:
  Indexes in Mongoid are defined as a hash of field name and direction/2d pairs, with a hash for any additional options.
Resolution:
  Ensure that the index conforms to the correct syntax and has the correct options.

 Valid options are:
 Â Â background: true|false
 Â Â drop_dups: true|false
 Â Â name: 'index_name'
 Â Â sparse: true|false
 Â Â unique: true|false
 Â Â min: 1
 Â Â max: 1
 Â Â bits: 26
 Â Â bucket_size : 1
 Valid types are: 1, -1, '2d', 'geoHaystack'

 Example:
 Â Â class Band
 Â Â Â Â include Mongoid::Document
 Â Â Â Â index({ name: 1, label: -1 }, { sparse: true })
 Â Â Â Â index({ location: '2d' }, { background: true })

Problem:
  Document(s) not found for class Route with id(s) 52396c6c8f16021911000033.
Summary:
  When calling Route.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 52396c6c8f16021911000033 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 52396c6c8f16021911000033.
Resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
